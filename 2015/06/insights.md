- Instead of storing a vast 2D array, store a dict with values of lights that are lit.
- A defaultdict() with int factory would have a default value of 0.
- Can use ^= for toggle
- For turn on and turn off, initialise arrays and assign instead of iterating
- [[0]\*1000]\*1000 would create 1000 copies of the [0]\*1000 object. Use list comprehension:
    - [[0]\*1000 for _ in range(1000)]
